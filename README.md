MALazykit
=========

Collection of extensions for easier object instantiation.

After adoption of ARC I tend to prefer using `[MyObject object]` than `[[MyObject alloc] init]`.  
So it's main purpose is to make your ARC code less verbose. 

## Usage

Import the main header file on your header prefix (.pch)

``` objective-c
#import "MALazykit.h"
```
